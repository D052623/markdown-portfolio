### Some Poetry
**Ho Ho! Ho! To the bottle I go**

*To heal my heart and drown my woe*

*Rain **may** fall, and wind may blow*

**And *many* miles be still to go**

But under a tall tree will I lie

* And let the clouds go sailing by
  * And do some other stuff like:
  1. sleep
     1. read
     2. eat
